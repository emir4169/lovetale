## LÖVETALE Engine
<p>My third attempt at writing an Undertale battle engine in LÖVE! I'm mostly writing this for personal use, but anyone can use this if they make their way through my garbage code.</p>

### Progress
<p>This engine is still unfinished. Acting and items are functional but fighting and mercy are still unfinished.

### Credits
<p>I'm the only person working on this engine, but I used stuff from these cool people!</p>
