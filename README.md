## LÖVETALE Engine
<p>My third attempt at writing an Undertale battle engine in LÖVE with a goal of providing an easy framework for anyone to make their own accurate fanmade battles.</p>

### Progress Roadmap
<p>As of right now, ACT and ITEM are completely finished. MERCY is *almost* finished but I have yet to code in the sparing particle system. FIGHT has started, but it's still a heavy work in progress because I'm having a hard time coding it in a way that I'd like. My goal right now is to finish fighting and to implement a bullet system for the monsters, but later on I'd like to write something like a wiki to better explain how this works, and to optimize the code so it works with love.js.</p>

### Credits
<p>I'm the only person working on this engine, but I used stuff from these cool people!</p>
